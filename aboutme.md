My name is Weiyuan Gong (龚维元), a first-year graduate student at [John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/). I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Sitan Chen](https://sitanchen.com/). I am working on exploring the intersection of quantum information, machine learning theory, and quantum complexity theory. I am also interested in other topics including near-term quantum applications, quantum simulation, optimization theory, and designing algorithms.

Before entering Harvard, I got my B.E. from Yao Class, [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) advised by [Prof. Dong-Ling Deng](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/dengdl/) at the [Center for Quantum Information (CQI)](https://cqi.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). Here is my [CV](assets/files/CV_WG_4_24.pdf).

## Miscellaneous

I enjoy driving, swimming, and playing table tennis. I was the leader and the co-founder of the table tennis team for IIIS. Appointments for playing table tennis are strongly welcomed! I also enjoy taking care of and playing with my potato kitty.
