My name is Weiyuan Gong (龚维元), and I'm currently a second-year graduate student at [John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://seas.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/), where I have the privilege of working with [Prof. Sitan Chen](https://sitanchen.com/). 

My research primarily focuses on the intersection of learning theory, complexity theory, and quantum information. Additionally, I am exploring a range of other topics, including near-term quantum applications, quantum simulation, optimization theory, and algorithm design.

Prior to my studies at Harvard, I completed my Bachelor of Engineering at Yao Class, [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), under the guidance of [Prof. Dong-Ling Deng](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/dengdl/) at the [Center for Quantum Information (CQI)](https://cqi.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

## Miscellaneous

I have a passion for driving, swimming, and playing table tennis. As the leader and co-founder of the table tennis team at IIIS, I enthusiastically welcome opportunities to play! Additionally, I take great joy in spending time with my significant other, whom I affectionately refer to as my 'potato kitty'. I’m grateful to my potato kitty for helping me polish my homepage.
