My name is Weiyuan Gong (龚维元), and I'm currently a graduate student at [John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://seas.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/), where I have the privilege of working with [Prof. Sitan Chen](https://sitanchen.com/). My research primarily focuses on the intersection of learning theory and complexity theory

## Miscellaneous

I have a passion for driving, swimming, and playing table tennis. As the leader and co-founder of the table tennis team at IIIS, I enthusiastically welcome opportunities to play! Additionally, I take great joy in spending time with my significant other, whom I affectionately refer to as my 'potato kitty'. I’m grateful to my potato kitty for helping me polish my homepage.
