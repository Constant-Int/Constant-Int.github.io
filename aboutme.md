My name is Weiyuan Gong (龚维元), and I'm currently a graduate student at John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University, where I have the privilege of working with [Prof. Sitan Chen](https://sitanchen.com/). My research primarily focuses on the applications of theory for machine learning and computer science in the physical world. Prior to my studies at Harvard, I completed my Bachelor of Engineering at Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (Yao Class), Tsinghua University, under the guidance of [Prof. Dong-Ling Deng](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/rydw/qzjs/dengdongling.htm).

## Miscellaneous

I have a passion for driving, swimming, and playing table tennis. As the leader and co-founder of the table tennis team at IIIS, I enthusiastically welcome opportunities to play! Additionally, I take great joy in spending time with my significant other, whom I affectionately refer to as my 'potato kitty'. I’m grateful to my potato kitty for helping me polish my homepage.
